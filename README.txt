== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the WordPress SEO Checklist plugin for? =

It automatically finds SEO issues on your site, based on this detailed [SEO Checklist](https://flexithemes.com/seo-checklist/).

= Does the WordPress SEO Checklist plugin modify my site? =

No! Our WordPress SEO Checklist plugin only checks for SEO issues and gives recommendations on how to resolve the issues. So it's perfectly safe and won't crash your site.

= Does the WordPress SEO Checklist plugin slow down my site? =

Absolutely not! The plugin doesn't run in the background, except for the few seconds when you run the analysis and your visitors won't be affected. It's a very light-weight SEO plugin.

= Is the WordPress SEO Checklist plugin free? What's the catch? =
Yes, our SEO checklist is totally free! There's no catch.

In the future, we'll develop more advanced features that will be part of a premium upgrade. That will cover our development costs.

= Who created the WordPress SEO Checklist plugin? =

FlexiThemes, developers of world's biggest [WP Themes](https://flexithemes.com/) club. We've been in business since 2009, focused exclusively on WordPress.

= What are your plans for the WordPress SEO Checklist plugin? =

We're adding more checks and will also create tools that fix SEO issues.

= What if I want an SEO expert to check the site? =

As with any tool, our plugin is very useful for saving time, but it's not a complete replacement for a manual site wellness check. We recommend hiring an SEO expert for a site audit once or twice a year.

= What if I want a feature added to the WordPress SEO Checklist plugin? =

We're taking all SEO feature requests and working on them based on popularity. Let us know what feature you'd like and we'll look into it.

= What if I want a feature added right away to the checklist? =
We're available for hire and would welcome any development sponsorships. Send us an email and we'll work out the details.

= Will this skyrocket my SEO? How can I improve my SEO beyond this WordPress SEO checklist plugin? =

Content is king for SEO. Plugins can help improve ranking, but there are many more factors to rank #1.

Our SEO checklist plugin covers items that we can programmatically check on your site. However, there are certain SEO things that are independent of your site and/or can't be automatically checked. If you'd like to learn more about those other items, then schedule out some time, grab some coffee, read through our *very long* ultimate [WordPress SEO Checklist](https://flexithemes.com/seo-checklist/).

When you're done with that one, try our [Google Search Console guide](https://flexithemes.com/wordpress-google-search-console/) for advanced tricks.

That will give you the SEO foundation and ninja skills you need to dominate the rankings.
